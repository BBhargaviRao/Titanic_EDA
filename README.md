What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in the data science process. It involves analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods, before applying more advanced techniques like machine learning models. In this project, I conducted EDA on the Titanic dataset to explore the relationships between passenger characteristics (age, class, gender, etc.) and their survival during the disaster.
